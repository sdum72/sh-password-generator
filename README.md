•	If none of the prompts are selected, the user will be asked to choose at least one in order to proceed.
If at least one of the prompts is selected, a password will be generated and will appear in the box. This will contain at least one of the characters selected by the user and the total number of characters will be as indicated by the user at the beginning.
